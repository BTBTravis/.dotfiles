* TODOs
** TODO Add old snippets
   YAS - Ya snippets is the built in but its kinda an ass pain to pull up snippets. Apparently there is snippet support for auto-complete??
 - [ ] Look into auto completion for snippets
 - [ ] JS Snippets [[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/BTBTravis/5b7ae1b83d1a6edbc6dae4328cc529fb/raw/e796f5541f61cd26adf601923c381d1058926b9e/javascript.snippets][gist containing js snippets]]
 - [ ] PHP Snippets
** TODO Add script / function to ssh into club fpm container and gulp sass
 Needs to print the results some how so we can tell if there are any errors so maybe it opens a shell, term/eshell, and runs the needed commands
** TODO Add some themes
   via theme layer?
** TODO setup script to launch current emacs file in php storem for debugging
   PHP bin location: /usr/local/bin/pstorm
   executing external commands https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ExecuteExternalCommand
** DONE Add auto compleation

 [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Btools/ycmd][You Complete Me Layer]] seems like a good place to start its runs externally to emacs and communicates with the software much unline how its built into vim I think. 
 Possibly better layer would be 'auto complete' mentioned by Mike Zamansky
 *Enabled auto-complete layer checkout [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Bcompletion/auto-completion][docs]]
** DONE Test tags are working in php and add them if needed

** DONE install ac-ispell@auto
   CLOSED: [2018-07-30 Mon 10:11]
   --> installing package: ac-ispell@auto-completion... [1/2]
   Package ac-ispell is unavailable. Is the package name misspelled?
   Problem:
     spelling packing not loading properly
   Solution: 
     seems to be linked to this package being for auto-complete and we are currently using company so I somply disabled the spell check layer

** DONE install php-extras@php
   CLOSED: [2018-07-30 Mon 10:10]
   Problem:

   An error occurred while installing php-extras (error: (wrong-type-argument package-desc nil))
   Fix:
